                 1. We test to make sure that scope.onChange is a function. If a 
                 future developer fails to pass a function to the on-change attribute 
                 in the HTML, the next line will not be reached, and no error will be thrown.
                 2. We pass a full function call to the on-change attribute in the 
                 HTML â€“ scope.onChange() calls the function in the attribute.
                 3. The function we pass in the HTML has an argument (value) which 
                 isn't defined in the view (it's not the same as scope.value). 
                 Using built-in Angular functionality, we specify the 
                 value of this argument using hash syntax (curly braces). Effectively, we're 
                 telling Angular to insert the local newValue variable as the value 
                 argument we pass into the SongPlayer.setCurrentTime() function 
                 called in the view.
