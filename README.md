# BlocJams (Angular Version)

This project was an extension of the BlocJams project, only I've reworked the code to implement AngularJS. Like the original project, this was also done by a step-by-step tutorial.

Start by cloning the Bloc Frontend Project Starter repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Bloc/bloc-frontend-project-starter.git <your-frontend-project-name>
```
